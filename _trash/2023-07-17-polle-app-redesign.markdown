# Overview

Polle is a social network for foodies. It's mission is to build the trusted network of people in discovering new places and products.

Polle enables people to discover new and interesting local places. Polle provides curated contents and restaurant search engine backed by user contributed data, rich place metadata, and mapping database.

The project was about to redesign the mobile application to engage user participation and to provide more convinence method to search restaurant informations.


# Background
Polle was a emergind startup with nimble, fast team. I joined Polle as a product designer. Team was organized with 1 data engineer, 1 software engineer, product designer and ux researcher and the external branding designer. I participated after 2.0 launched and soon dive in to complite redesign of it.

roles I did

- Supporting user research with UX researcher.
- Rebuilding UX flow structure of the application.
- Establishing a design system.


# Problem
after lunciont 2.0 app, we did basic user research and we found that user's experience is not as we expected

Original App Structure
*image*
- Home (follow timeline) 
- Discover (Search/Geo/category based timeline)
- Map (pinned map/ map based Search)
- Profile

Since we grow from social network service, the most important feature was follow network. 
so main tab was follow timeline.
from that, we build search and discover features, in seperated tabs and that caused problem.

from the user research, we found that user does not understand discover and map structure.
user followes the path they get used before.
Search was devided in two, with seperate minor features

- quantative
    - by data analyse, we found that 40% use discover and 40% use map. the user use both tab was only 15%.
    - only 20% of the user was followeing others, the timeline was empty for them
- qualitive
    by user testing, we found that user do not understand place(geo based), item(non-geobased) categorizing and seperated way to search them.
    

Prioritise for the next iteration of the product, w


# Solution
We should provide more intutive, user-action based structure of the application.
Structure must not follow the data structure but the user path.




# Process

## Discover

## Define

## Ideate

## Implement

- final user testing
